Flutter Issue Tracker

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

Flutter Issue Tracker is a hybrid application which lists the "issues" from the "Flutter" repository in Github.com. 
The application is capable of: 

* see a list of all issues of a Flutter GitHub repository (https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
* be able to navigate to a detail screen of an issue that features relevant information
* see the already visited issues distinguished at the list of all issues
* be able to switch between dark and light modes
* be able to sort and filter the list of issues

The core features of the app includes:

* Issues list page
 * Pagination with an infinitely scrolling list
 * Filtering and sorting issues
 * Tapping on an issue should navigate to the detail page 
 * Visited issues are distinguished from others
* Issue detail page
 * Display title,author,description,creation date and other relevant information.
* Other
 * error handling

Technical features and implementation includes:|

* The project uses CLEAN architecture with BloC as the State management tool.
* The code is hence made as scalable and maintainable
* 80%+ coverage with unit and widget tests (An example golden test)
* Leverages GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API
* A CI on GitHub Actions on deploying Android Production level Application.
* Deploy app to Firebase App Distribution - https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/e3c84871fd066b1c

- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Flutter Issue Tracker works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
